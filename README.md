# SMS/email Spam Filteration using NLP
The project aims at filtering any spam message or e-mail .It is trained on the concepts of Natural Language Processesing and using nltk library.
The dataset contains about 5000+ examples of mixed spam and ham . 
The model then uses a XGBoost classifier which helps to scale up its performance to a very awing 98.65 % accuracy.
I tried to madke the dataset as clean as possible , applied various nlp techniques to improve the overall accuracy .
The model can be of great usage as developed for the spam detection in various environments.
I have to explain the code as much as possible so that it is easily accesible by all.
